## About
Docker Image for creating a service container providing an framebuffered X11-Server ([xvfb](http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml)) in conjunction with a VNC-Server ([x11vnc](http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/)). It allows to get the display of an application running inside a docker container to the host or any other machine accessing the VNC-Server.

It is intended to be used in conjunction with at least one other container hosting the application requiring an X-Server (aka X-Client). This differentiates it from other solutions running the X-Server, the VNC-Server and the X-Client in the same container.

A base image for creating a container with an application using this X11 server container can be found [here](tbd).

My intention for this image was to have a clear separation of concerns. This image is responsible for all the X-Server stuff. Another image can fully concentrate on the application and is simply linked to a container of this image.

More details can be found [here](https://github.com/bmustiata/x11server/blob/master/Story.md).

## Usage

Running a container based on this image is quite easy. It is intended to be run as daemon. So you can run via:

`docker run -d --name display -e VNC_PASSWORD=newPW -e XFB_SCREEN=1280x800x24 -p 5900:5900 bmst/x11server`

You should give it a name (here `display`), because a container running the client should be linked with this container. Forwarding the port `5900` allows you to access the VNC server from within your network.

### Environment Variables
When you start the `x11server` image, you should adjust at least some of its configuration.

Hint: In case you don't like to type the environment variables on the command prompt, docker run can also read it from a config file (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#examples_8)). Especially for passwords (see below) this this should be done to prevent any issues with your shell history (see [here](http://linuxcommando.blogspot.de/2014/07/hide-command-from-bash-command-line.html)).

`VNC_PASSWORD`

This variable is mandatory and specifies the password you need to enter into your VNC-client when connecting to the VNC-Server running in a container from this image.

`XFB_SCREEN`

Specifies screen width, height, and depth (WxHxD). By default, screen has the dimensions 1024x768x24.

### docker-compose
You can use `docker-compose` to avoid typing or copy-and-pasting all the stuff again and again on the command line. Here an excerpt from a `docker-compose.yml` file starting a container from this image:

```
xserver:
	image: bmst/x11server
	ports:
		- 5900:5900
	environment:
		VNC_PASSWORD: yourPW
		XFB_SCREEN: 1280x800x24
```

Save this inside `docker-compose.yml`, add a proper password and call `docker-compose up`. Now you will have a running X11 server waiting for X11 clients and VNC clients to connect.

## Maintenance
The image is build on Docker hub with [Automated builds](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/). There is no dedicated maintenance schedule for this image. It is relying on packages from `debian:jessie` and thus I do not assume to update it frequently.

In case you have any issues, you are invited to create a pull request or an issue on the related [github repository](https://github.com/bmustiata/x11server.git).
